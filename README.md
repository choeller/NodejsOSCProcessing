NodejsOSCProcessing
===================

LAN communication between a web-based javascript client and a java app using OSC. All based on Processing, using nodejs in the middle.

SimpleNodejs is the Processingjs which stands for the web-client
SimpleOSC is the Processing app which stands for the OSC listening app
nodejsServer is in the middle, communicating to the other two, in this example acting as a simple pipe which passes on the messages.
